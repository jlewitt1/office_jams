# wepack-config

CLI tool to generate [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) for you.

## Usage

```bash
npm i -g create-webpack-config
webpack-config init
```

After that, you can run 
```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Why
People always say [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) is HARD to get started (you can google it if you don't believe me). But people are also working on this to make it easier to use, with different approaches:

- boilerplate
- better documents(especially @TheLarkInn, @sokra and other team members)
- ... ...

With the popularize of Create-React-App (CRA), I think it's worth another shot by building a **CLI tools** to provide single command to get started with  [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

​After all,  [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) is a GREAT tool  and we all love it :two_hearts: :two_hearts: :two_hearts: !
